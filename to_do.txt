TO DO (03/08/2024):
[X] Enable potion mixing in starting flasks - I had already fixed this bug. The person who reported it must have been playing on an older version.
[X] Clear up developer text when picking up the sampo
[X] Clear up developer text on vampire field when healing to full
[X] Make hiisi base anvil biome inherit hiisi base biome modifier
[X] Acid Mist
[X] Comment out unfinished gold spells






















OLD TO DO LIST (MAY NOT BE UP TO DATE)

[ ] Make needed functions in gun_utilities.lua
[X] Clean up utilities.lua and make functions match my modern naming conventions
[ ] Clean up gui_utilities.lua
[ ] Create definitions for my custom gui objects
[ ] Need to see if Nolla moved anything in recent patches
[ ] Make injection logic for pixel scene list instead overwriting the file
[ ] Make injection logic for chest loot tables instead of overwriting the file
[ ] Check item and potion spawn lists to see if Nolla has changed those
[ ] Diminution Mist?
[ ] Add logic to alchemy station for hiisi alkemisti flasks to retain their shape
