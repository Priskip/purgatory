TO DO:
[ ] Make needed functions in gun_utilities.lua
[X] Clean up utilities.lua and make functions match my modern naming conventions
[ ] Clean up gui_utilities.lua
[ ] Create definitions for my custom gui objects
[ ] Need to see if Nolla moved anything in recent patches
[ ] Make injection logic for pixel scene list instead overwriting the file
[ ] Make injection logic for chest loot tables instead of overwriting the file
[ ] Check item and potion spawn lists to see if Nolla has changed those
[ ] Diminution Mist?


TBH maybe it's worth looking into rewriting the core systems of Purgatory...
